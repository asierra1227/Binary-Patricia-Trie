Binary Patricia Trie

Project file located in /src/solutions/BinaryPatriciaTrie.java.

Description: Binary Patricia trie contains insertion, deletion, lookup, and a few other methods.
Each node of trie contains the following information:
1. The index of the character in the input key to test at that node.
2. The left and right child of the node, one for each of the 2 possible next values(0 or 1) in the
key, respectively.
3. The key itself, if the key ends at the index.
